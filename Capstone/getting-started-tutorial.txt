## STEP 1 - Create an application called contacts

## STEP 2 - Create a model - db_contacts.py
db.define_table(
   'company',
   Field('name', notnull = True, unique = True), format = '%(name)s')
db.define_table(
   'contact',
   Field('name', notnull = True),
   Field('company', 'reference company'),
   Field('picture', 'upload'),
   Field('email', requires = IS_EMAIL()),
   Field('phone_number', requires = IS_MATCH('[\d\-\(\) ]+')),
   Field('address'),
   format = '%(name)s'
)

## STEP 3 - Add this to controller default.py to disply companies data
## URL will be:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacts/default/companies
def companies():
    grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.company)
	return dict(grid=grid)
	
## STEP 4 - You want to add records
## add this line in front of the companies function you just created
@auth.requires_login()

## refresh the companies screen
## you will now need to login 
## you can use the register link to set up an account

## STEP 5 - Add this to default.py controller to set up contacts
## URL will be: http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacts/default/contacts
@auth.requires_login()
def contacts():
    grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.contact)
    return dict(grid=grid)
	
## STEP 6 - create a new index page
## put this code in the file views - default/index.html
## leave the line that says: {{extend 'layout.html'}}
## replace everything else with the HTML below
## then go to URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacts/default/index
## or click Home in the navigation
<h1>Hello World Demo App</h1>
<h2>This is the index.html template</h2>

   Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and   first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

    {{ = A('Go To Company List', _href = URL('companies'))}}
</p>

## STEP 7 - Update the navigation at the top to link to the new pages
## edit models menu.py
## delete lines 49-108
## put these lines after line 48
    (T('Companies'), False, URL('default', 'companies'), []),
    (T('Contacts'), False, URL('default', 'contacts'), [])
## refresh the page and the navigation should change
